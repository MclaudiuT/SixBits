Based on the current information, these applicants possess the fundamental backend development skills and experience with relevant technologies (cloud platforms, containerization, databases, and backend 
programming languages) mentioned in the job description. However, none explicitly state "proven experience as a Backend Developer with a focus on machine learning applications" or showcase projects involving
the integration of machine learning models.

Therefore, based on the strict requirement of "proven experience as a Backend Developer with a focus on machine learning applications" and "Familiarity with machine learning frameworks and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)", 
*no applicants fully meet all the mandatory requirements* as described in the provided job description excerpts.
